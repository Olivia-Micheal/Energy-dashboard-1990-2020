## Project Overview

This dashboard was built to track and communicate insights around fossil fuel energy usage across multiple regions using data from Kaggle (1990–2020). The data was cleaned in Power Query and modeled with Power Pivot to build an interactive reporting experience.

---

## Objectives

- Identify top CO₂-emitting countries
- Compare energy production vs. consumption
- Track renewable adoption by region
- Highlight efficiency improvements over time
- Showcase net surplus/deficit by country

---

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel 2019
- Power Query
- Power Pivot
- Pivot Tables & Charts
- Slicers, Custom KPI Cards
- Excel dashboard design

---

## Dashboard Insights

- **China**, the **US**, and **India** rank highest in CO₂ emissions.
- **Europe** and **Oceania** lead in renewable adoption.
- Several African nations show production-consumption imbalance.
- Efficiency improved globally between 2000–2020.

## KPI Descriptions

| KPI | Description | Unit |
|-----|-------------|------|
| Total Energy Produced | Sum of energy produced | Mtoe |
| Total Energy Consumed | Sum of consumption | Mtoe |
| Top CO₂ Emitter | Static value from data | Country |
| Most Efficient Region | Based on lowest energy intensity | Region |

---

## Data Cleaning Process

- Removed duplicate rows
- Filtered nulls and blanks
- Renamed long column headers
- Converted values to 1 decimal place
- Added new calculated columns (Efficiency, Net Energy)

---

## Recommendations

- Invest in clean energy in high-emission countries
- Balance production vs. consumption across regions
- Improve efficiency in regions with high intensity values
- Use dashboards like this for policy decisions
